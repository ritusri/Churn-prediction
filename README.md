# Customer Churn Prediction In Telecommunications

In summary, from my project, “Customer Churn Prediction”, clean the data, explore the data with different visualizations, model our data with different data mining algorithms, interpret our results by several evaluation metrics and update our model are the typical processes involved. From simple data cleaning to the addition of new features, or removing unimportant features, scaling or normalising features, a data mining project stands and a lot of research are done to develop the techniques to deal with the data at each level.
